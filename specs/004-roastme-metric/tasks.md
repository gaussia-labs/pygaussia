# Tasks: Roast Me — Profile-then-Exploit Adversarial Evaluation

**Input**: `specs/004-roastme-metric/plan.md`
**Prerequisites**: `plan.md`, `data-model.md`, `spec.md`

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description (FR / SC)`

- **[P]**: can run in parallel — different files, no dependency between them
- **[Story]**: which user story the task serves; unmarked tasks serve all of them
- Every task carries the requirement or success criterion it exists for. Every path comes from the plan's
  file tables. Tests are written and verified failing before the code that satisfies them.

---

## Phase 1: Schemas & Contracts

The ten abstractions carry no logic, so they can be written at once. None may import an embedder or a
graph library: FR-037 requires them importable with no extra installed.

- [x] T001 [P] `Grader` in `src/gaussia/core/grader.py` — one principle's violation for a query and a
      response, with the evidence behind it (FR-005)
- [x] T002 [P] `ProbeEngine` in `src/gaussia/core/probe_engine.py` — can-handle, the entity kinds it
      declares it handles, plus documents and catalogue to tagged probes (FR-019, FR-021, FR-025)
- [x] T003 [P] `EntityEnumerator` in `src/gaussia/core/entity_enumerator.py` — the entities of a kind that
      exist in the base. Interface only; gaussia ships no implementation (FR-019, D14)
- [x] T004 [P] `HookVerifier` in `src/gaussia/core/hook_verifier.py` — confirm a hook's `doc` label
      against the corpus (FR-019)
- [x] T005 [P] `Transform` in `src/gaussia/core/transform.py` — a real entity to a probe's premise (FR-019)
- [x] T006 [P] `TargetAssistant` in `src/gaussia/core/target_assistant.py` — a query in, a `TargetResponse`
      out, or the exchange marked failed (FR-017, FR-018)
- [x] T007 [P] `QueryGenerator` in `src/gaussia/core/query_generator.py` — a category's attributes to
      concrete queries. Separate from the search so invariant 5 is checkable (FR-033)
- [x] T008 [P] `OnProfileFilter` in `src/gaussia/core/on_profile_filter.py` — how on-profile one query is,
      which is what the `κ` gate compares against, plus the `κ` an implementation recommends on its own
      scale, defaulting to none (FR-030, FR-041)
- [x] T009 [P] `RealismEstimator` in `src/gaussia/core/realism_estimator.py` — distance from the
      natural-query prior, without querying the assistant, plus the `δ` it recommends on the same terms
      (FR-031, FR-041)
- [x] T010 [P] `CategorySearch` in `src/gaussia/core/category_search.py` — a profile to scored categories
      (FR-033)
- [x] T011 Every model of `data-model.md` in `src/gaussia/schemas/roastme.py`, with the validators it
      specifies: contract weights summing to `1 ± 1e-9` and one grader per principle (FR-001, FR-003);
      `Probe.plugin` empty if and only if `hook.principle` is empty (FR-011); `TargetResponse` rejecting
      empty content that is not marked failed (FR-016); `doc` in `{0,1}`; `Category.provenance` the same
      length as `attributes` (FR-028); the grader config carrying the verdict surface forms,
      `reasoning_budget`, `fallback_samples` and `top_logprobs`, all required (FR-006); and
      `ExploiterConfig` splitting its thresholds as `data-model.md` specifies — `tau` and `eta` required,
      `lambda_`, `queries_per_category` (floor 2) and `pool_size` defaulted, `kappa` and `delta` optional
      (FR-040, FR-041)
- [x] T012 Re-export the ten abstractions from `src/gaussia/core/__init__.py` and extend `__all__` — they
      carry no heavy imports, so they belong on the re-exported side of that file's own rule (FR-037)
- [x] T013 Add the schema pointer to the `src/gaussia/schemas/__init__.py` docstring — **no eager import** (FR-037)
- [x] T014 Add the `roastme` extra to `pyproject.toml`:
      `["sentence-transformers>=5.0.0", "torch>=2.0.0", "networkx>=3.0"]`. Out of the `metrics` and `all`
      aggregates (FR-037)

**Checkpoint**: `uv run python -c "import gaussia.core"` succeeds with no extra installed.

---

## Phase 2: Tests (Red Phase)

Nothing that depends on Phase 3+ implementation may pass. The conformance tests (T027), the hermeticity
enforcement (T029) and the fixture self-checks exercise only Phase 1 artefacts and the doubles, so they
are green from the start — that is what confirms Phase 1 landed, not a leak. The package markers and the
doubles come first because everything else needs them.

- [x] T015 [P] Package markers: `tests/generators/roastme/__init__.py`, `tests/graders/__init__.py`,
      `tests/fixtures/roastme/__init__.py`. Every test directory in this repo has one
- [x] T016 Deterministic doubles in `tests/fixtures/roastme/` — one per interface: a grader with
      prescribed per-principle scores, a grader whose provider exposes no usable logprobs (SC-009), a
      target returning recorded responses, a target reporting a failed exchange (SC-008), a probe engine,
      an entity enumerator, a hook verifier, a query generator, a category search, and — for the
      threshold paths — an on-profile filter and a realism estimator in two variants each, one
      recommending a threshold and one recommending none (SC-012)
- [x] T017 Hand-computed probe fixtures in `tests/fixtures/roastme/` — the expected `v`, rates and
      standard errors worked out from the paper's equations, so assertions are arithmetic and not
      snapshots (SC-001, SC-002)
- [x] T018 [P] [US1] `tests/generators/roastme/test_scoring.py` — `v` with its per-principle grades
      retained (FR-004), the weakness-map rate and its standard error (FR-012), `S(c)` (FR-029),
      the `κ` gate zeroing a query (FR-030), the `δ` budget discarding a category (FR-031), refinement to
      the minimal sub-conjunction (FR-032) (SC-001, SC-002, SC-007)
- [x] T019 [P] [US1] `tests/generators/roastme/test_profiler.py` — control exclusion driven purely by a
      strategy with no plugin, including the pair of probes over the same documented entity that land on
      opposite sides of that line (FR-011, SC-003); a failed exchange recorded ungraded and moving neither
      numerator nor denominator (FR-016, SC-008); the profile crossing with prose and no strategy
      identifiers (FR-013)
- [x] T020 [P] [US1] `tests/graders/test_logprob.py` — the verdict located at the last matching token, not
      the first (FR-007); discarded when the model's own final answer does not parse to one (FR-007); the
      sampling fallback marked as such (FR-008, SC-009)
- [x] T021 [P] [US2] `tests/generators/roastme/test_dataset.py` — the conversion fills every required
      framework field as `data-model.md` specifies, `evidence_available` survives it, and `Toxicity`
      consumes the result with no change to it — chosen because it reads the assistant's answer alone,
      where `Humanity` and `Vision` score against an expected answer this conversion leaves empty
      (FR-034, SC-006)
- [x] T022 [P] [US3] `tests/generators/roastme/test_catalogue.py` — every rejection path: dangling
      principle, dangling plugin, unknown transform, `doc` outside `{0,1}`, duplicate identifier, and an
      `entity_kind` no configured engine handles (FR-025, FR-026, SC-005)
- [x] T023 [P] [US3] `tests/generators/roastme/test_library.py` — engine composition and duplicate merging
      with the originating engine recorded (FR-022); the graph engine's absence labels confirmed by exact
      enumeration and the retrieval engine's marked unreliable (FR-023, SC-004); the enumeration engine
      refusing to run with no enumerator injected (D14); no knowledge base yielding domain-agnostic probes
      with an empty hook (FR-024)
- [x] T024 [P] [US4] `tests/generators/roastme/test_exploiter.py` — the failure report ranked by `S(c)`
      with the individual queries at or above `τ` surfaced (FR-035), an auditable category-evaluation
      record carrying the per-query rationale (FR-036), and the report recording which implementation of
      each substitutable piece produced it, with the `κ` and `δ` in force (FR-039, FR-041)
- [x] T025 [P] [US4] `tests/generators/roastme/test_thresholds.py` — the four resolution paths of
      `data-model.md`'s table: recommendation used, user override winning over a recommendation, **failure
      at construction** when a configured component recommends nothing and nothing is supplied, and the
      supplied value accepted when it recommends nothing. Plus `queries_per_category = 1` rejected, with
      the fixture that shows why — at `n = 1` the penalised score equals the unpenalised mean
      (SC-012, SC-013)
- [x] T026 [P] [US4] `tests/generators/roastme/test_policy_gradient.py` — the loop with a stub policy and a
      stub update step, on CPU, with no extra installed: exactly `k` queries requested per iteration, the
      `κ` and `δ` gates dropping the right ones, the reward matching hand computation, the loop stopping on
      its budget, and the query generator unmodified across iterations (FR-033, SC-014)
- [x] T027 [P] Contract tests: every double in T016 satisfies its `core/` interface, so a third-party
      implementation has an executable definition of conformance (FR-019)
- [x] T028 [P] Import isolation (FR-037, SC-011): every interface imports with no extra installed, and
      `import gaussia.generators.roastme` succeeds too — which fails if `probes/__init__.py` ever
      re-exports an engine
- [x] T029 [P] The default suite is hermetic (SC-010): no test opens a socket, requires credentials or
      requires a GPU. Enforce rather than assert by convention — anything that needs one of those carries
      a marker and is deselected by default

**Checkpoint**: `uv run pytest tests/generators/roastme tests/graders --maxfail=0 --no-cov
--continue-on-collection-errors` runs and **every test that depends on Phase 3+ implementation fails**,
each one on a missing `gaussia.generators.roastme` or `gaussia.graders` — never on a wrong signature, a
`SyntaxError` or a collection error against something Phase 1 already delivered. Conformance, hermeticity
and the fixture self-checks pass. The three flags are required: `addopts` carries `--maxfail=5`, which
would truncate the run, and `--cov-fail-under=50`, which would fail for a reason unrelated to the phase.

---

## Phase 3: US1 — Profiler (Green)

- [x] T030 [US1] `src/gaussia/generators/roastme/searches/scoring.py` — the violation score, the
      weakness-map rate with its sample size and standard error, `S(c)`, the `κ` and `δ` comparisons and
      refinement. Pure functions over values: no I/O, no model (FR-004, FR-012, FR-029…FR-032)
- [x] T031 [US1] `src/gaussia/graders/logprob.py` and `__init__.py` — the shipped base grader: last
      verdict-shaped token in the sequence, discarded when the final answer does not independently parse
      to one, sampling fallback over `k` marked as fallback-derived (FR-007, FR-008)
- [x] T032 [US1] `src/gaussia/generators/roastme/profiler.py` — drive the injected target over a probe
      set, grade each response, aggregate the weakness map and the retained hooks, strip strategy
      identifiers from what crosses, and emit `ProfilerResult` (FR-010…FR-016)
- [x] T033 [US1] T018, T019 and T020 pass

**Checkpoint**: a profile can be built with no credentials, no network and no GPU, by pointing the target
interface at a recorded response set.

---

## Phase 4: US2 — Roast Dataset (Green)

- [x] T034 [US2] `src/gaussia/generators/roastme/dataset.py` — the output-boundary conversion, filling
      every required framework field as specified and carrying the record's own fields as turn metadata
      (FR-034)
- [x] T035 [US2] T021 passes

**Checkpoint**: a run's output is consumable by an existing metric unmodified.

---

## Phase 5: US3 — Probe Library (Green)

- [ ] T036 [US3] `src/gaussia/generators/roastme/probes/transforms.py` — the four `Transform`
      implementations and the registry that resolves the catalogue string **once**, so nothing branches on
      it afterwards (FR-025)
- [ ] T037 [US3] `src/gaussia/generators/roastme/probes/catalogue.py` — validate a catalogue against a
      contract **and against the configured engines' declared entity kinds** before generation runs
      (FR-025, FR-026, FR-027)
- [ ] T038 [P] [US3] `src/gaussia/generators/roastme/probes/retrieval.py` — the retrieval engine,
      recording on every absence probe that its label is unreliable (FR-021, FR-023)
- [ ] T039 [P] [US3] `src/gaussia/generators/roastme/probes/graph.py` — the graph engine, confirming
      absence from the complete graph (FR-021)
- [ ] T040 [P] [US3] `src/gaussia/generators/roastme/probes/grag.py` — the multi-hop engine, false
      premises spanning several entities (FR-021, FR-022)
- [ ] T041 [P] [US3] `src/gaussia/generators/roastme/probes/enumeration.py` — the enumeration engine,
      opt-in, refusing to run until an `EntityEnumerator` is injected. Reads `Document.structured` to know
      whether a document's boundary can be enumerated (FR-022, D14)
- [ ] T042 [US3] `src/gaussia/generators/roastme/probes/library.py` and `__init__.py` — compose the
      applicable engines, merge duplicates, record the originating engine, run the first three by default
      and the enumeration engine only when configured, and return domain-agnostic probes with an empty
      hook when there is no knowledge base. **`probes/__init__.py` must not import any engine** (FR-020,
      FR-022, FR-024, FR-037)
- [ ] T043 [US3] T022 and T023 pass

**Checkpoint**: probes can be generated from a knowledge base and a user-supplied catalogue.

---

## Phase 6: US4 — Exploiter (Green)

Three reference implementations land here. Only the estimator's construction comes from the paper; the
other two are gaussia's own, and each must say so in its docstring (FR-039).

- [ ] T044 [P] [US4] `src/gaussia/generators/roastme/searches/realism.py` — the base realism estimator:
      expected cosine distance from a prior pool through an injected embedder, which is the instantiation
      the paper gives. Composes the framework's existing embedder rather than encoding vectors itself, and
      declares the `δ` it recommends for its own scale (FR-031, FR-039, FR-041)
- [ ] T045 [P] [US4] `src/gaussia/generators/roastme/searches/query_generation.py` — the base query
      generator: a category's attributes to concrete queries through the user's model. Gaussia's own
      construction, not the paper's (FR-039)
- [ ] T046 [P] [US4] `src/gaussia/generators/roastme/searches/on_profile.py` — the base on-profile filter,
      declaring the `κ` it recommends. Gaussia's own construction, not the paper's (FR-039, FR-041)
- [ ] T047 [US4] `src/gaussia/generators/roastme/searches/thresholds.py` — resolve `κ` and `δ` once:
      user value wins, otherwise the configured component's recommendation, otherwise **refuse to
      construct**, naming the component and the parameter (FR-041, SC-012)
- [ ] T048 [US4] `src/gaussia/generators/roastme/searches/attribute_iteration.py` — the training-free
      search: the common attributes of the highest-scoring pool, then attribute subsets. No GPU (FR-033)
- [ ] T049 [US4] `src/gaussia/generators/roastme/exploiter.py` and `src/gaussia/generators/roastme/searches/__init__.py` — compose
      search, query generator, on-profile filter, estimator and target; resolve the thresholds through
      T047 at construction; emit the Roast Dataset and the failure report with the individual queries at
      or above `τ` surfaced alongside the category verdict, and with the implementations and the resolved
      thresholds recorded on it (FR-030, FR-034…FR-036, FR-039, FR-041)
- [ ] T050 [US4] `src/gaussia/generators/roastme/__init__.py` — re-export `ProbeLibrary`, `Profiler`,
      `Exploiter`. **Do not touch `src/gaussia/generators/__init__.py`**: it imports eagerly, and
      registering there would make `import gaussia.generators` require an embedder (FR-037)
- [ ] T051 [US4] T024, T025 pass, the full default suite passes, and T028 and T029 still hold

**Checkpoint**: the whole subsystem runs end to end on any machine, offline, against a recorded target,
with only `τ` and `η` supplied.

---

## Phase 7: The reinforcement-learning search (opt-in)

The loop is ordinary code and belongs in the default suite. Only the weight update needs the extra, which
is why the two live in different modules.

- [ ] T052 Add the `roastme-rl` extra to `pyproject.toml`:
      `["gaussia[roastme]", "peft>=0.10.0", "accelerate>=0.25.0", "trl>=0.8.0"]`. Out of the `metrics` and
      `all` aggregates (FR-037)
- [ ] T053 [US4] `src/gaussia/generators/roastme/searches/policy_gradient.py` — the policy-gradient loop
      behind the same search interface, taking the policy it samples from and the update step it applies
      as injected collaborators. Those two abstractions stay in this module rather than in `core/`: they
      are collaborators of one shipped search, not part of the specification a user implements against.
      **Imports nothing heavy**, so T026 runs in the default suite. Leaves the query generator unmodified
      (FR-033, SC-014)
- [ ] T054 [US4] `src/gaussia/generators/roastme/searches/policy_update.py` — the training-backed update
      step: the only module in the subsystem that imports the RL stack, and the only one marked
      `requires_gpu`, so the default suite deselects it (FR-037)

---

## Phase 8: Documentation and example

- [ ] T055 `docs/advanced/roastme.mdx` — alongside `generators` and `prompt-optimizer`, not under
      `docs/metrics/`, because this is not a metric. Must state that no grader has been calibrated against
      human labels and that the figures are a judge-only measurement (FR-038); that the query generator and
      the on-profile filter are gaussia's own construction rather than the paper's, so substituting them
      changes what the search measures (FR-039); that `κ` and `δ` come from the configured component and
      why (FR-041); and that the training-free search has no published result behind it
- [ ] T056 Register the page in **both** navigation registries: `advanced/roastme` in `docs/docs.json` and
      `sdks/python/advanced/roastme` in `docs/docs-sync.json`. The second is the one that publishes to the
      docs site, so listing only the first leaves the page unpublished (FR-038)
- [ ] T057 [P] `examples/roastme/catalogue/` — schema examples for `PluginSpec` and `StrategySpec`: the
      shape with domain-neutral prose, **not** a domain catalogue (FR-027)
- [ ] T058 [P] `examples/roastme/jupyter/` — a runnable notebook: build a contract, validate a catalogue,
      profile a recorded response set through the target interface. Carries the complete worked
      `ExploiterConfig`, `τ` and `η` included, so the two required thresholds are copied from a visible
      reference rather than guessed. Mirrors `examples/privacy/jupyter/` (FR-014, FR-040)

---

## Phase 9: Polish

- [ ] T059 `uv run ruff check .` passes
- [ ] T060 `uv run ruff format .` leaves no diff
- [ ] T061 `uv run mypy src/gaussia` passes
- [ ] T062 `uv run pytest` passes with the configured coverage floor

---

## Dependencies

- T001–T010 are independent of each other. T011 depends on them for the types it references; T012 depends
  on all ten existing.
- Phase 2 depends on Phase 1: a test cannot import an interface that does not exist.
- T015 and T016 block every other test task; T017 blocks T018 and T019; T016's two-variant filter and
  estimator block T025.
- Phases 3 through 6 depend on Phase 2 being red. Within them T030 comes first, because the Profiler, the
  Exploiter and the weakness map all consume it.
- US1 (Phase 3) and US3 (Phase 5) are independent once Phase 2 is done and can proceed in parallel. US2
  (Phase 4) needs US1 for something to emit. US4 (Phase 6) needs US1 for a profile to search from.
- Within Phase 6, T044–T046 are independent; T047 needs T046 and T044 for something to read a
  recommendation from; T049 needs T047.
- Phase 7 depends on T049, since the policy-gradient search plugs into the same exploiter. T054 depends on
  T052 for the extra and on T053 for the abstraction it implements.
- Phase 8 depends on Phase 6: documenting an interface that is still moving wastes the writing.
- Phase 9 depends on everything.
