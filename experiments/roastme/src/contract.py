"""Contract of the Universal Probe Library — THE DURABLE PART.

This is the stable part of the module: it defines WHAT a document, a probe and a
hook are, and the signature every engine must satisfy. The engines (deterministic,
RAG, GraphRAG) are INTERCHANGEABLE implementations behind this contract. Switching
engines changes nothing that the rest of the pipeline (Profiler, Exploiter) sees.

    engine.generate(documents, plugins, strategies) -> list[Probe]

Design (key decisions, open to revision):
  - Document.structured decides which engine can handle it (the selector uses this).
  - KnowledgeHook.doc (1 documented / 0 invented) is the GROUND TRUTH of the
    downstream test; .verified stores whether a HookVerifier confirmed that label.
  - Probe.engine records which engine produced it -> enables the comparative results.
